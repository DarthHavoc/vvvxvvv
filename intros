Subject: Introduction: New Senior Security Analyst at Vectra AI

Dear Vectra AI Team,

I'm thrilled to join the Vectra AI team as a Senior Security Analyst supporting MDR after five enriching years at Deloitte's Cyber Security practice, primarily focused on Government and Public Services. My role involved conducting cyber threat hunting, detecting and mitigating advanced threats, optimizing security tools, and driving SOC maturity. I also worked closely with federal clients to enhance their security posture, implement risk management programs, and employ cutting-edge security tools. I'm eager to leverage my experience to contribute to Vectra AI's success and collaborate with all of you in advancing our security initiatives.

Best Regards,
