Forensics / context
No detection, but the technique is being logged for forensic purposes and can be used to provide context.

Basic
Detection is in place using a basic signature to detect a specific part(s) of the technique's procedures.
Therefore, only a minimal number of aspects of the technique are covered. Hence the number of false negatives is high and possible (but not necessarily) a high false positive rate. Detection is possibly not real time.
2
Fair
The detection no longer only relies on a basic signature but makes use of a (correlation) rule to cover more aspects of the technique's procedures. Therefore, the number of false negatives is lower compared to
"1/Poor" but may still be significant. False positives may still be present. Detection is possibly not real time.

Good
Effective in detecting malicious use of the technique by making use of more complex analytics. Many known aspects of the technique's procedures are covered.
Bypassing detection by means of evasion and obfuscation could be possible. False negatives are present. False positives may still be present but are easy to recognize and can possibly be filtered out.
Detection is real time.
4
Very good
Very effective in detecting malicious use of the technique in real time by covering almost all known aspects of the technique's procedures. Bypassing detection by means of evasion and obfuscation methods is harder compared to level "3/good". The number of false negatives is low but could be present. False positives may still be present but are easy to recognize and can possibly be filtered out.

Excellent
Same level of detection as level "4/very good" with one exception: all known aspects of the technique's procedures are covered. Therefore, the number of false negatives is lower compared to level "4/very good".
